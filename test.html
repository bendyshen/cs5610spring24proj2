    <h1>Welcome to Conway's Game of Life</h1>
    <p>Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It's a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.</p>
    
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>A living cell with less than two live neighbours dies (as if by underpopulation).</li>
      <li>A living cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.</li>
      <li>A living cell with more than three live neighbours dies (as if by overpopulation).</li>
      <li>A dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (as if by reproduction).</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Explore the game and have fun seeing how different patterns evolve over time!</p>
